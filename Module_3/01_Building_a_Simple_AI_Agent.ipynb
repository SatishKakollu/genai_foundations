In the case below, we are going to use the common `yfinance` Python package to create a simple tool that downloads data from the Yahoo! Finance API.  We specify our tools with the LangChain `@tool` decorator, which takes a normal Python function and turns it into a LangChain tool that can be used by an agent.\n",

There are many different agent types that you can use, which are documented [here](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/agents/langchain.agents.agent_types.AgentType.html).  Note that not all agents work with all models (ex: `OPENAI_FUNCTIONS`).  In this case, we are using a zero-shot ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) agent, which is a simple place to start."

    "Agents are all the rage right now in GenAI.  As such, working with agents is a very hot area with a lot of development.  As you read through various bits of documentation on LangChain, you will no doubt come across LangGraph, which is LangChain's new approach to working with agents, including multi-agent workflows.  \n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph is very powerful and LangChain is moving all of its agentic workflows to this platform.  However, it is still quite new and in a constant state of flux.  Additionally, it has a very steep learning curve and the documentation has not caught up to its development yet.  Because of this, we have stayed away from it for this workshop since it would be very difficult to cover it within a single day's class.  That being said, the interested student should definitely take a look at it since this is where all of LangChain's work is moving towards in the future."
