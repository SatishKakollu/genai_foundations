You might find it helpful to go beyond the `RetrievalQA.from_chain_type()` in Module 3 Activity 3 and explore using `create_stuff_documents_chain` and `create_retrieval_chain`.  You also might find it useful to add memory to your chain so that you can continue to ask questions until you land on the answer you like for your submissions."
