Since their\\ncomposition four hundred years ago, Shakespeare\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plays and poems\\nhave traveled the globe, inviting those who see and read his works to\\nmake them their own.\\nReaders of the New Folger Editions are part of this ongoing process\\nof \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctaking up Shakespeare,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d finding our own thoughts and feelings in\\nlanguage that strikes us as old or unusual and, for that very reason,\\nnew. We still struggle to keep up with a writer who could think a mile\\na minute, whose words paint pictures that shift like clouds. These\\nexpertly edited texts are presented to the public as a resource for\\nstudy, artistic adaptation, and enjoyment. By making the classic texts\\nof the New Folger Editions available in electronic form as Folger\\nDigital Texts, we place a trusted resource in the hands of anyone who\\nwants them.\\nThe New Folger Editions of Shakespeare\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plays, which are the basis\\nfor the texts realized here in digital form, are special because of their\\norigin. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is the\\nsingle greatest documentary source of Shakespeare\\xe2\\x80\\x99s works. An\\nunparalleled collection of early modern books, manuscripts, and\\nartwork connected to Shakespeare, the Folger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s holdings have been\\nconsulted extensively in the preparation of these texts. The Editions\\nalso reflect the expertise gained through the regular performance of\\nShakespeare\\xe2\\x80\\x99s works in the Folger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Elizabethan Theater.\\nI want to express my deep thanks to editors Barbara Mowat and Paul\\nWerstine for creating these indispensable editions of Shakespeare\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nworks, which incorporate the best of textual scholarship with a\\nrichness of commentary that is both inspired and engaging. Readers\\nwho want to know more about Shakespeare and his plays can follow\\nthe paths these distinguished scholars have tread by visiting the Folger\\neither in-person or online, where a range of physical and digital\\nresources exists to supplement the material in these texts. I commend\\nto you these words, and hope that they inspire.\\nFrom the Director of the Folger Shakespeare Library\\nUntil now, with the release of the Folger Digital Texts, readers in\\nsearch of a free online text of Shakespeare\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plays had to be content\\nprimarily with using the Moby\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 Text, which reproduces a late-\\nnineteenth century version of the plays. What is the difference? Many\\nordinary readers assume that there is a single text for the plays: what\\nShakespeare wrote. But Shakespeare\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plays were not published the\\nway modern novels or plays are published today: as a single,\\nauthoritative text. In some cases, the plays have come down to us in\\nmultiple published versions, represented by various Quartos (Qq) and\\nby the great collection put together by his colleagues in 1623, called\\nthe First Folio (F). There are, for example, three very different\\nversions of Hamlet, two of King Lear, Henry V, Romeo and Juliet,\\nand others. Editors choose which version to use as their base text, and\\nthen amend that text with words, lines or speech prefixes from the\\nother versions that, in their judgment, make for a better or more\\naccurate text.\\nOther editorial decisions involve choices about whether an unfamiliar\\nword could be understood in light of other writings of the period or\\nwhether it should be changed; decisions about words that made it into\\nShakespeare\\xe2\\x80\\x99s text by accident through four hundred years of\\nprintings and misprinting; and even decisions based on cultural\\npreference and taste. When the Moby\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 Text was created, for\\nexample, it was deemed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimproper\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindecent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for Miranda to\\nchastise Caliban for having attempted to rape her. (See The Tempest,\\n1.2: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAbhorred slave,/Which any print of goodness wilt not\\ntake,/Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). All Shakespeare\\neditors at the time took the speech away from her and gave it to her\\nfather, Prospero.\\nThe editors of the Moby\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 Shakespeare produced their text long\\nbefore scholars fully understood the proper grounds on which to make\\nthe thousands of decisions that Shakespeare editors face. The Folger\\nLibrary Shakespeare Editions, on which the Folger Digital Texts\\ndepend, make this editorial process as nearly transparent as is\\npossible, in contrast to older texts, like the Moby\\xe2\\x84\\xa2, which hide\\neditorial interventions. The reader of the Folger Shakespeare knows\\nwhere the text has been altered because editorial interventions are\\nsignaled by square brackets (for example, from Othello: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c If she in\\nTextual Introduction\\nBy Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine\\nchains of magic were not bound, \\xe2\\x80\\x9d), half-square brackets (for\\nexample, from Henry V: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith blood  and sword and fire to win your\\nright,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), or angle brackets (for example, from Hamlet: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cO farewell,\\nhonest soldier.  Who hath relieved/you?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). At any point in the text,\\nyou can hover your cursor over a bracket for more information.\\nBecause the Folger Digital Texts are edited in accord with twenty-first\\ncentury knowledge about Shakespeare\\xe2\\x80\\x99s texts, the Folger here\\nprovides them to readers, scholars, teachers, actors, directors, and\\nstudents, free of charge, confident of their quality as texts of the plays\\nand pleased to be able to make this contribution to the study and\\nenjoyment of Shakespeare.\\nEvents before the start of Hamlet set the stage for tragedy. When the\\nking of Denmark, Prince Hamlet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father, suddenly dies, Hamlet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nmother, Gertrude, marries his uncle Claudius, who becomes the new\\nking.\\nA spirit who claims to be the ghost of Hamlet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father describes his\\nmurder at the hands of Claudius and demands that Hamlet avenge the\\nkilling. When the councilor Polonius learns from his daughter,\\nOphelia, that Hamlet has visited her in an apparently distracted state,\\nPolonius attributes the prince\\xe2\\x80\\x99s condition to lovesickness, and he sets\\na trap for Hamlet using Ophelia as bait.\\nTo confirm Claudius\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guilt, Hamlet arranges for a play that mimics\\nthe murder; Claudius\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reaction is that of a guilty man. Hamlet, now\\nfree to act, mistakenly kills Polonius, thinking he is Claudius.\\nClaudius sends Hamlet away as part of a deadly plot.\\nAfter Polonius\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death, Ophelia goes mad and later drowns. Hamlet,\\nwho has returned safely to confront the king, agrees to a fencing\\nmatch with Ophelia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brother, Laertes, who secretly poisons his own\\nrapier. At the match, Claudius prepares poisoned wine for Hamlet,\\nwhich Gertrude unknowingly drinks; as she dies, she accuses\\nClaudius, whom Hamlet kills. Then first Laertes and then Hamlet die,\\nboth victims of Laertes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 rapier.\\nSynopsis\\nTHE GHOST\\nHAMLET, Prince of Denmark, son of the late King Hamlet\\n and Queen Gertrude\\nQUEEN GERTRUDE, widow of King Hamlet, now married to Claudius\\nKING CLAUDIUS, brother to the late King Hamlet\\nOPHELIA\\nLAERTES, her brother\\nPOLONIUS, father of Ophelia and Laertes, councillor to King Claudius\\nREYNALDO, servant to Polonius\\nHORATIO, Hamlet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s friend and confidant\\nFORTINBRAS, Prince of Norway\\nA Captain in Fortinbras\\xe2\\x80\\x99s army\\nAmbassadors to Denmark from England\\nPlayers who take the roles of Prologue, Player King, Player Queen,\\nand Lucianus in The Murder of Gonzago\\nTwo Messengers\\nSailors\\nGravedigger\\nGravedigger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s companion\\nDoctor of Divinity\\nAttendants, Lords, Guards, Musicians, Laertes\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Followers, Soldiers,\\nOfficers\\nCharacters in the Play\\ncourtiers at the Danish court\\nVOLTEMAND\\nCORNELIUS\\nROSENCRANTZ\\nGUILDENSTERN\\nOSRIC\\nGentlemen\\nA Lord\\nDanish soldiers\\nFRANCISCO\\nBARNARDO\\nMARCELLUS\\nBARNARDO\\nFRANCISCO\\nBARNARDO\\nFRANCISCO\\nBARNARDO\\nFRANCISCO\\nBARNARDO\\nFRANCISCO\\nBARNARDO\\nFRANCISCO\\nBARNARDO\\nFRANCISCO\\nHORATIO\\nEnter Barnardo and Francisco, two sentinels.\\n  Who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s there?\\n \\n Nay, answer me.

As we have seen here, frequently the LLM output does not line up with what these strict parsers want as input.  Therefore, if you are dealing with an output beyond something very basic, creating custom parsers is the way to go."
